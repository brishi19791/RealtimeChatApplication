# RealtimeChat---socket.io

This is a NodeJS powered realtime chat application that I casually developed for my roommates. The application features user logging into the chat interface, participating in the group chat (i.e., Chat Room) by sending and receiving messages and signing off. The project introduced me the nuances of Socket Programming and usage of WebSocketAPI enabling bi-directional communication between server and client.
